# Time Bank Exchange

Time Bank Exchange is a peer-to-peer platform that allows users to trade skills and services using time credits instead of money.

Many people have valuable skills but lack access to affordable services or opportunities.
Time Bank Exchange removes money as a barrier by allowing users to exchange time and skills directly.

- Users earn time credits by providing a service
- Time credits can be spent receiving services from others
- All services are valued equally by time, not money
- The system encourages fairness and community participation

- User profiles with listed skills
- Time credit tracking system
- Service request and fulfillment flow
- Ratings or feedback system (future)
- Admin moderation tools (future)

Planned Tech Stack:
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Java or Python
- Database: Relational or NoSQL (TBD)
- Authentication: Basic user accounts (future)

Status:
Project planning and system design completed for academic requirements. Ready for development if continued.

This project was created as part of coursework to demonstrate system planning, user flow design, and application logic for a real-world platform.
